## 🧠 Concepts Covered

### 1️⃣ Normal Distribution

- Symmetrical bell-shaped curve
- Mean = Median = Mode
- Data spreads around the mean
- Defined by:
  - Mean (μ)
  - Standard Deviation (σ)

### 2️⃣ Z-Score

Z-Score measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean.

### 📌 Formula:

```
Z = (X - μ) / σ
```

Where:
- X = Data value
- μ = Mean
- σ = Standard deviation
